Questions?
Homework
100-150 words defining the problem (topic 1.1.1)

**Reflection (25 September 2019)**
We created a system diagram and learned how to upload it to github, then we created an installation file for the client in which we had a problem, the installation was not happening in the desired path.<br/>
Homework: provide a default folder/path for the installation inside Desktop, create the uninstall script



**Reflection (25 September 2019)**
Today we created an install program for the client, we had to make it as simple as possible so that the client can use it with ease, the installation was creating a folder for the database and scripts. We also tried to find a way to create a frame, which would pop up when the client successfully inputs a car into the database, it was hard to understand, it requires a bit of math and logic to make the frame.
Homework: Give the user the ability to uninstall the program; delete the folders.

I learned how to make a program that allows the client to input car information and it saves it into a database, we used the command for arguments, we also created a program for creating a car.
Homework: Figure out a way to delete the car files and information
