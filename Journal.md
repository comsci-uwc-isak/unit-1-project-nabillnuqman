Reflection (24 September 2019)
What did we do today?
Today we had 6 warm up questions which were non coding, we had to identify the input and outputs of a program and identify the steps for the solution
What did you learn?
I learned how to write my programs generally so that programmers that use any other language of bash can understand
Questions?
Homework
100-150 words defining the problem (topic 1.1.1)

**Reflection (25 September 2019)**
We created a system diagram and learned how to upload it to github, then we created an installation file for the client in which we had a problem, the installation was not happening in the desired path.<br/>
Homework: provide a default folder/path for the installation inside Desktop, create the uninstall script



**Reflection (25 September 2019)**
Today we created an install program for the client, we had to make it as simple as possible so that the client can use it with ease, the installation was creating a folder for the database and scripts. We also tried to find a way to create a frame, which would pop up when the client successfully inputs a car into the database, it was hard to understand, it requires a bit of math and logic to make the frame.
Homework: Give the user the ability to uninstall the program; delete the folders.


**Reflection (30 September 2019)**
I learned how to make a program that allows the client to input car information and it saves it into a database, we used the command for arguments, we also created a program for creating a car.
Homework: Figure out a way to delete the car files and information


**Reflection (2 October 2019)**
Today we presented different bash programs we were assigned to, I was assigned to create a delete car program which deletes the car file and car line information. I found a way to delete the file line information but that required to put the car line information inside the code, I had a problem finding a way to implement an argument into the code and deleting that line using the argument.


**Reflection (7 October 2019)**
Today we ran several test on our program, We learned how important tests are, there are two different types of testing, Dynamic and static testing. Dynamic testing is actually executing the code whereas static testing is just reading over the code. We ran alpha testing, dynamic testing, and whitebox texting. Homework: Create and fix delete car program
Homework Update: I found a way to delete a line in the file using an argument, I used sed and apparently for mac terminal it requires a '' after s the -i.

Q1. What skills have you developed so far?
I've recently built up the skill of asking for help when I need it, I feel that recently I've been more open to asking questions in class when I do not understand something, even if I do not understand something in class and wait, I still turn to my good friend Shin for help. I went from no knowledge in programming at all to an adequate level of skill in my opinion, I've learned a lot in these past 2 months or so.

Q2. What have worked for you in the classroom of CS?
I think sitting next to people I'm comfortable asking questions to, I usually sit around the same people for the reason that I don't feel embarrased asking questions to them. As annoying as they are, reflections are actually pretty helpful, just even to look back and remind myself of what I've learned so far and some of the difficulties experienced. 

Q3. What are some things/activities/strategies that you would change in the CS classroom to achieve your best in the next 6 weeks.
I think prioritizing my work and keeping up with the homework is my main concern so I want to improve in those things because what usually happens is I go to class and we are given homework and I come to the next class clueless. Another I should do is revising whatever I have learned, the syntax, the commands, steps and etc. I do forget easily, even after a day after class. So what I should do is spend the time I have free on revising and reminding myself of what I've learned.
